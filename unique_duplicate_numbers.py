# 1. Start with an empty list called 'numbers' to keep track of what the user enters.
# 2. Use a loop to continuously ask the user for a number.
# 3. Check if the number is already in 'numbers'
#    - If yes, print "Duplicate"
#    - If no, print "Unique" and add it to 'numbers'
# 4. If the user enters an invalid input, exit the loop and end the program.
